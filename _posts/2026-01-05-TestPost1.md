## Why I started using LLMs at work

I began experimenting with large language models to reduce repetitive
engineering tasks such as data inspection, rule checking, and API exploration.

This post records **what actually worked and what didn’t**.

## Typical use cases

### 1. Code exploration
When working with unfamiliar APIs (e.g. Revit API), LLMs help me:
- Quickly locate relevant classes
- Understand call sequences
- Generate small test snippets

### 2. Log & error analysis
Feeding real error logs often reveals:
- Hidden assumptions
- Incorrect API usage
- Missing edge cases

---

## Limitations observed

- Hallucinations on undocumented APIs
- Overconfidence in generated solutions
- Requires constant validation against real code

LLMs are **assistants, not authorities**.

## Takeaway

LLMs are most effective when used as:
> a fast-thinking junior engineer who still needs review.

I plan to keep documenting concrete cases as I integrate AI into
engineering workflows.
